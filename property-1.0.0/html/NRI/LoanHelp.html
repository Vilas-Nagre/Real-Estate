        <p>An NRI applicant is <strong>eligible to get a home loan </strong>ranging from a minimum of Rs 5 lakhs to a maximum of Rs 1 crore, based on the repayment capacity and the cost of the property, which although is variable by the priorities of the home loan provider.</p>
<p>Also <strong>Home Loan Tenure for</strong> NRIs is different from Resident Indians. An applicant will be eligible for a maximum of 85% of the cost of the property or the cost of construction as applicable and 75% of the cost of land in case of purchase of land, based on the repayment capacity of the borrower.However, a NRI can enhance his loan eligibility by applying for home loans with a co-applicant who has a separate source of income.</p>
<p>The <strong>rate of interest</strong> for home loans to NRIs is higher than those offered to Resident Indians. The difference is to the extent of 0.25%-0.50%. Some HFCs also have an internally earmarked <strong>‘negative criterion’</strong> for NRI home loans. As such, the NRIs who hail from locations that are marked as being ‘negative’ in the books of HFCs, find it difficult to get a home loan.</p>       
<h2>RBI Directive Loans</h2>
        <!-- <ul>
            <li>The home loan amount must not exceed 85% of the cost of the dwelling unit. The remaining 15% must be provided as an own contribution.</li>
            <li>Funds must be routed through normal banking channels (e.g., NRE/ NRO/ FCNR accounts).</li>
            <li>Repayment must be done through foreign inward remittances or NRE/ NRO accounts.</li>
            <li>Loans can be availed for property purchase, construction, or renovation.</li>
        </ul> -->
        <p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has clarified that the NRIs and Resident Indians can also acquire immovable property in India other than agricultural property, plantation or a farmhouse.</p>
          <p>Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) and Persons of Indian Origin (PIO), purchasing immovable property in India should pay for the acquisition by funds received in India through normal banking channels by way of inward remittance from outside the country. RBI has also issued certain directives for sanctioning home loans to Non-Resident Indians. The guidelines provided are –</p>
       <ul>
        <li>The home loan amount should not exceed 85% of the cost of the dwelling unit, as the remaining amount that is 15% needs to be provided as an own contribution towards the cost of the unit financed.</li>
      <li>The cost of dwelling unit which is own contribution financed less the loan amount, can be met from direct remittances from abroad through normal banking channels, the Non-Resident (External) [NR(E)] Account and /or Non-Resident (Ordinary) [NR (O)] account in India.</li>
    <li>
        Repayment of the loan, comprising of the principal and interest including all the charges are to be remitted to the HFC from abroad through normal banking channels, the Non-Resident (External) [NR(E)] Account and /or Non-Resident (Ordinary) [NR (O)] account in India.</li>
    <li>The repayment option for NRIs as they can pay through the funds held in any non-resident account maintained in accordance with the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999, and the regulations made by the RBI from time to time. As most of the home loan provider companies consider the economic stability of the applicant, home loans for NRIs are quite feasible, because they are well in economic resources.</li>

        <p>Another vital document required while processing an NRI home loan is the power of attorney (POA). The POA is important because, since the borrower is not based in India; the HFC would need a  ‘representative’ ‘in lieu of’ the NRI to deal with and if needed. Although not obligatory, the POA is usually drawn on the NRIs’ parents/wife/children.</p>
       <p>The documents needed for obtaining NRI home loans are:</p>
